# Generate and excute a collision-free trajectories using the Pionner P3dx robot in coppeliasim.

This project showcases the application of the D* path planning algorithm to navigate two Pioneer P3DX robots in a CoppeliaSim environment, enabling them to swap their initial positions without collisions. The project includes the generation of collision-free trajectories and their execution within the simulated workspace.

## Setup

1. **CoppeliaSim Scene**: Load a scene with the Pioneer P3DX robot with the HW6.ttt file attached.
2. **Script Placement**: Place `path_planner.py` and `execute_path.py` in the same directory if not attached already in the .ttt file.
