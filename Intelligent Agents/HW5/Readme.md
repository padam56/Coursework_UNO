# Generate and excute a trajectory using the Pionner P3dx robot in coppeliasim.

This project demonstrates the implementation of the D* path planning algorithm to navigate a Pioneer P3DX robot in the CoppeliaSim environment. It includes generating a trajectory and executing it within a simulated environment.

## Setup

1. **CoppeliaSim Scene**: Load a scene with the Pioneer P3DX robot with the HW5.ttt file attached.
2. **Script Placement**: Place `path_planner.py` and `execute_path.py` in the same directory if not attached already in the .ttt file.
