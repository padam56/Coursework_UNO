The one counts the number of ‘1’s in v. Set MAX =200, thus reset the algorithm 200 times for the global maximum and print the found maximum-value for each reset separated by a comma in the Output.txt file."

    "Simulated Annealing algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization method inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It is used to find the global optimum of a given cost function. The algorithm starts with a random solution and iteratively improves it by making small random changes. The acceptance of these changes is guided by a temperature parameter that is gradually decreased over time. The algorithm terminates when the temperature reaches a predefined minimum value or a satisfactory solution is found."

    "In SA, alpha is often used to refer to the cooling rate, which is the rate at which the temperature T decreases over time. The cooling rate determines how quickly the algorithm transitions from exploring the solution space to exploiting the current solution. A high cooling rate allows for more rapid exploration of the solution space, but may also cause the algorithm to converge prematurely to a suboptimal solution. A low cooling rate allows for a more thorough exploration of the solution space, but may also cause the algorithm to take a long time to converge to an optimal solution. The optimal cooling rate depends on the specific problem and the desired trade-off between exploration and exploitation."
